# Fingerprint_module_R305---Python_and_MySQL
Fingers enrolled using the R305 module and stored in a database along with the person's name. Next just by typing the persons name, his/her finger template can be stored  or deleted in the R305 module ready for authentication.
Limitations
-----------

	1. Storage space: Datasheet says storage capacity is 256.
	2. Physical presence: Physical presence of person is required everytime we delete and store somebody's finger template in the R305 module.
	3. Time: Storing large number of finger templates is time consuming and tedious.
	4. Backup: Damge or loss of the R305 module results in entire data loss.

Limitations overcome with database
----------------------------------

	1. Storage space: Storage capacity is limited by your hard disc space. You can store almost any number of finger templates.
	2. Physical presence: Once the finger template of a person is stored in databse, we can delete and store the person's finger template in the R305 module without his/her physical presence.
	3. Time: Finger print templates in database can be stored in the R305 module in a blink of an eye.
	4. Backup: If R305 module is damaged or lost, data can be retrived from databse and stored on a new R305 module.
